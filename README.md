# Bad Apple Video Player for Minecraft Hologram Plugin

This is a fork of https://github.com/TheCymaera/minecraft-hologram that is customized to run when a music disk is inserted into a jukebox to play a video with sound


You will need a paper server, compile the project and move the jar into your plugins folder. You will need a resource pack if you want audio.

This still uses display entities and will show on vanilla clients, this is just a test quickly thrown together so expect some bugs
