# Bad Apple Video Player for Minecraft Hologram Plugin

This is a fork of https://github.com/TheCymaera/minecraft-hologram that is customized to run when a music disk is inserted into a jukebox to play a video with sound.

## Features
 Video plays when a player manually inserts a music disc into a jukebox
 Video plays when a dropper automatically inserts a music disc into a jukebox (configurable)

## Configuration

The plugin uses `music_disc_config.yml` for configuration. some intresting stuff check it out

### Other Settings
- Video quality and frame rate
- Display position and orientation
- Audio settings
- Custom disc appearance

## Installation

You will need a paper server, compile the project and move the jar into your plugins folder. You will need a resource pack if you want audio.

This still uses display entities and will show on vanilla clients, this is just a test quickly thrown together so expect some bugs
