# Yes... this runs bad apple in minecraft, and every other video also!

## This is a simplified version of https://github.com/TheCymaera/minecraft-hologram that is seperated developed to run video in vanila minecraft using display entities.
### This current version is current intergrated into the fork at my other repo. Https://github.com/Blake1332/minecraft-hologram/tree/main
You will need a paper server, compile the project and move the jar into your plugins folder. You will need a resource pack if you want audio.
This still uses display entities and will show on vanilla clients, this is just a test quickly thrown together so expect some bugs
